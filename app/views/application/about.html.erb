          First your score is computed for each language using this formula :
          <div class="">
            <pre>
              <code class="language-html" data-lang="html">sum(stars) + (1.0 - 1.0/count(repositories))</code>
            </pre>
          </div>
          
          <p>Then you are ranked according to your score compared to other developers with repositories in the same languages, in the same location (by city, by country or worldwide).</p>
          
          <p>If you're interested in the ranking you should have a look at the SQL query that generates the ranking table : <a href="https://github.com/vdaubry/github-awards/blob/master/sql/rank.sql">rank.sql</a></p>

          GitHub Awards retrieves data from 2 sources :
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.githubarchive.org/">GitHub Archive</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          
          For a detailed explanation of how the data were processed, see the project readme : <a href="https://github.com/vdaubry/github-awards">https://github.com/vdaubry/github-awards</a>

          We get the number of stars for each repos from <a href="https://www.githubarchive.org/">GitHub Archive</a>. Most likely the data for some of your repos are not up to date.
          
          We plan to add GitHub connect and allow you to ask for a refresh. In the meantime you can reach me on Twitter if some of your datas are not accurate : @vdaubry

          The GitHub search is great and you should use it everytime it can answer your question. However there are some things that can't be done with GitHub search :
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              The main difference is that you can't search for YOUR ranking with GitHub search.
            </li>
            <li>
              You cannot search for top users by total number of stars
            </li>
            <li>
              Location on GitHub is a plain text field, so if you search for users in "San Francisco", you won't find user with location "SF, CA" or any other variations. You cannot either search for users by country if they only filled their city.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          GitHub Awards geocodes user locations, so provided you filled your city in your location, you can have your ranking in your city, in your country, and worldwide.

          At the moment i excluded organization from the ranking calculation in order to have a user only ranking. If you would like to have an organization ranking send me a tweet and we'll talk about it.

          I care a lot about this project not being creepy : it doesn't display your name or your email, you cannot search for someone by name or get access to their email. Only GitHub username, avatar, repository list, location, and repositories language.
          
          Though we don't display it, the database might contain informations <strong>already publicly available</strong> on your GitHub profile :
          <ul>
            <li>
              Email
            </li>
            <li>
              Full name
            </li>
            <li>
              Location
            </li>
            <li>
              Picture (avatar)
            </li>
            <li>
              Website or blog URL
            </li>
            <li>
              Company
            </li>
          </ul>
